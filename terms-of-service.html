    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="all-caps">TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL PEPTIDEPAL, ITS AFFILIATES, DEVELOPERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE.</p>
        <p class="all-caps">THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF PEPTIDEPAL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING IS IN ADDITION TO AND NOT IN LIEU OF THE LIABILITIES DISCLAIMED IN THE MEDICAL DISCLAIMER.</p>
        <p>In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless PeptidePal, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the App.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
        <p>You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Los Angeles County, California to resolve any dispute or claim arising from these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>12. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration</h2>
        <p><strong class="all-caps">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Most user concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting us at support@peptidepal.app. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</p>
        
        <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.</p>
        
        <p>You and PeptidePal agree that any and all claims will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and PeptidePal agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and PeptidePal are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
        
        <p>The arbitration shall be conducted by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitration shall be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, unless we agree otherwise. Each party will bear its own costs in arbitration.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> YOU AND PEPTIDEPAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>13. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the App will cease immediately. All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through the App.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>15. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>16. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and Medical Disclaimer, constitute the entire agreement between you and PeptidePal regarding your use of the App and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral.</p>
